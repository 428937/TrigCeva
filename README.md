# TrigCeva

In triangle ABC, three Cevians AD, BE, and CF are concurrent if and only if the following identity holds:

(AF / FB) * (BD / DC) * (CE / EA) = 1

This known as Ceva's Theorem. The theorem also has a lesser-known trigonometric form:

(sin(∠ABE) / sin(∠CBE)) * (sin(∠BCF) / sin(∠ACF)) * (sin(∠CAD) / sin(∠BAD)) = 1

or equivalently,
sin(∠ABE) * sin(∠BCF) * sin(∠CAD) = sin(∠CBE) * sin(∠ACF) * sin(∠BAD).

This code solves for an unknown angle in the trigonometric Ceva equation. For further information please check,
